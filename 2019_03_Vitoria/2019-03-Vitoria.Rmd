# A2.1.1: Field monitoring and sampling

## Pathogen presence/absence

.font140[
NEIKER provided field sampling data for the following pathogens:

- *Armillaria mellea*: 1016 obs. (395/621) (after cleaning)

- *Diplodia sapinea*: 922  obs. (700/222) (after cleaning)

- *Fusarium circinatum*: 922 obs. (781/141) (after cleaning)

- *Heterobasidion annosum*: 1016 (785/231) (after cleaning)

# A2.1.1: Field monitoring and sampling

## Defoliation data

NEIKER gathered in-situ information in 2016 and 2017.

### 2016

- Demonstration plots (Luiando, Oiartzun, Laukiz 1-3, Hernani)

- Sampling of all trees in the plot

- Total amount of sampled trees: ~ 1800

### 2017

- Sampling of all 28 plots (Total # of obs.: 1400)

- 50 trees per plot

- Sampling scheme from FSU

# A2.1.4: Envir. condi. as predisp. factors

.font140[
The following variables were collected:

- Long-term **precipitation** (1950 - 2000)

- Long-term **temperature** (1950 - 2000)

- Long-term **PISR** (1950 - 2000)

- **Soil** type (at 250 m res.)

- **Lithology** type (at 1 km res.)

- **pH** value (at 1 km res.)

- Probability of **hail damage** at trees (200 m res.)

# A2.1.6: Hyperspectral img acquisition

.font160[
* Hyperspectral imagery was acquired by HAZI in September 2016 for all plots (28 in total)

* Unfortunately, one of the five "demonstration plots" ("hernani") was not covered by the flight mission

* FSU helped with the planning of the flight routes (Marco Pena)

# A2.1.6: Hyperspectral img acquisition

.font160[
* Hyperspectral satellite Hyperion-1 was decomissioned in January 2017 without prior notice

* Hyperspectral Airborne AVIRIS data as a replacement not suitable (price, flights only in US)

* No other spaceborne hyperspectral sensor available
